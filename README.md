# Dashboard Directory Size
[WordPress dashboard widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dashboard-directory-size/) that displays a list of common WordPress directories and their sizes.  Handy if you need to keep an eye on the size of your WordPress install.  Custom directories can also be configured.
